# HTML_finalproject
Youtube and spotify music identification (Andy and Eason)
Final project of HTML in Semester fourth

## Introduction
In this final project, you will have the opportunity to participate in an exciting machine learning com-
petition. It is well-known that music can set the mood at a party. However, if the music played fails to
inspire joy and encourage dancing among the crowd, it can actually ruin the party atmosphere. That is
where “danceability” comes into play—an index that describes how suitable a track is for dancing. Your
objective will be to predict the danceability of various tracks, which will be quantized into 10 scales.
In particular, imagine you are the DJ for the final party of the HTML course. Your friend, Nijika,
the manager of STARRY LiveHouse, requires your help to spice up the party by picking more danceable
tracks from some library. You need to study different approaches for danceability prediction and then
recommend Nijkia some of them in order to accomplish this task. The accuracy of the approaches that
you study will be reflected through your competition on some internal scoreboard. Then, you need to
submit a comprehensive report that describes not only your recommended approaches to Nijika, but also
the reasoning behind your recommendations. Oh, Nijika only speaks English, and hence you need to
write your report in English. Well, let’s get started!
